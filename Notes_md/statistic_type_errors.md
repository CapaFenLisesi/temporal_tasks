2016-06-01

Statistic Type errors are the errors taken by doing a statistical hypothesis testing.

The common errors are:
* Type I error: rejecting the null hypothesis when it is true.
* Type II error: accepting the null hypothesis when it is false.
* Type III error: correctly rejecting or accepting the null hypothesis for the wrong reason.
